zkSampler is a zero-knowledge audio sampling proof system that lets you prove you used a particular sample and only applied valid transformations — without revealing the sequence or parameters of those transformations.

This enables verifiable sampling in creative workflows, while preserving artistic privacy and creative freedom.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

zkSampler generates a zero-knowledge proof that:
- You used a specific audio sample.
- You applied only approved operations:
- 🔁 Reverse
- 🎚 Pitch shift (semitones)
- ⏱ Time stretch (scaling factor)
- You did not apply any unauthorized edits to the audio.
- Optionally: You are the authorized signer (e.g. sample owner, licensee).

✅ All without revealing:
- The specific transformations used,
- The order or number of transformations,
- The content of the original sample.

---

## 🧬 Note on Transformations

Currently:

Pitch shifting also affects time/stretch due to underlying DSP implementation.
This will be decoupled in future updates for independent pitch and time control.

---

## 🌍 Why This Is Useful

### ✅ For Artists & Producers
- Prove fair usage of commercial or licensed samples.
- Keep your workflow and style private.

### 🛠 For DAWs & Audio Plugins
- Add transparent traceability to sampling workflows.
- Support for plugin-side zk integration is coming soon.

### 📦 For Sampling Platforms (e.g. Splice)
- Enable proof-backed attribution for sample creators.
- Boost royalty tracking, usage insights, and trust.

### 🤖 In an AI-Generated Audio World
- Anchor transformations in provable logic.
- Enable attribution and originality for synthetic music.

## 🔍 Inspiration

zkSampler is inspired by [Attested Image Editor](https://blog.succinct.xyz/tales-from-the-hacker-house-building-an-attested-image-editor/). We bring the same spirit to the world of sound.

## 🚀 Usage Guide

#### 🧰 Prerequisites
- Rust + Cargo
- [SP1 SDK](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/getting-started/install)
- WAV files in assets/
- [Foundry's cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) (for Ethereum signing)

---

#### 📝 1. Sign Audio Hash

```bash
# Get hash of input audio
cargo run --release --bin audio_hash -- --input assets/sample.wav > audio_hash.txt

# Sign using Foundry's cast
cast sign <HASH> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> > sample.sig

# Generate public key from private key
cast wallet address --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> > sample.pub
```

Save:

- sample.sig → signature file
- sample.pub → public key file

#### ⚙️ 2. Local Execution (No Proof)

```bash
cargo run --release --bin zk-sampler -- \
--execute \
--input assets/sample.wav \
--output-audio out.wav \
--sample-rate 44100 \
--transform-json transform.json
```

#### 🔐 3. Local Proof Generation

```bash
cargo run --release --bin zk-sampler -- \
--prove \
--input assets/sample.wav \
--output proof.bin \
--output-audio out.wav \
--sample-rate 44100 \
--transform-json transform.json \
--signature sample.sig \
--public-key sample.pub
```

This command will also generate `public_values.bin` as one of the proof artifacts.

#### 📤 4. Decode Public Values

```bash
cargo run --release --bin decode_public -- --input public_values.bin
```

Outputs:
- original_audio_hash
- transformed_audio_hash
- signer_public_key
- has_signature

These can be verified in smart contracts or shared alongside releases.

📄 Example transform.json
```
[
    "Reverse",
    { "Pitch": 3 },
    { "Stretch": 1.25 }
]

```
